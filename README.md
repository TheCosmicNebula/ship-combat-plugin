# Ship Combat

A RuneLite plugin designed to help with ship combat. This plugin provides visual overlays that account for the unique "Boat Plane" mechanics, including non-rigid tile rotations and sub-tile distance checking.

Now works with Sloops, including Sloops with multiple cannons. Improved performance for Daisy turning radius, and overlap colors for Sloops with multiple cannons on the same side. All configurable.

## Features

*   **Cannon Firing Arc:** Displays a dynamic 180° firing zone anchored to your cannon facilities, showing exactly which tiles are within range of your cannon.
*   **Rotation Sweep (The Daisy):** Visualizes the "composite footprint" of your ship. This merged shape shows every tile your ship could possibly occupy as it rotates, allowing you to position your ship perfectly.
*   **Dynamic Attack Ranges:** Unlike standard NPCs, sea monster attack ranges are calculated against your ship's **rotated hull**.
    *   **Green:** The monster is safe and cannot hit you.
    *   **Yellow:** The monster has entered your rotation sweep and if aggravated will hit your ship in 1 tick.
    *   **Red:** The monster is in immediate contact with your current hull tiles and will hit your ship instantly if aggravated.
*   **Overhead Combat Timers:** Tick counters for your cannon cooldown and sea monster attack intervals.
*   **Corpse Despawn Timers:** Tracks sea monster remains to show exactly how long you have to loot before they vanish.
